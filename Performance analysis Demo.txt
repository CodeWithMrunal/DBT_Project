Awesome, Mrunal! Since you’ve completed both **Streaming** and **Batch** processing, you're now at the **final phase**: **Evaluation and Performance Comparison**. This is where you analyze how your system performs in both modes and validate the results.

---

## ✅ 1. **Define What You're Comparing**

You should compare:

| Metric               | Streaming Mode (Spark)            | Batch Mode (MySQL SQL)         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Execution Time**   | Time to process each micro-batch  | Time to run batch SQL queries  |
| **Latency**          | Delay between arrival and processing | Instantaneous (since it's all at once) |
| **Resource Usage**   | CPU & Memory (Spark job)          | CPU & Memory (during script run) |
| **Accuracy**         | Are counts matching batch results? | Are they correct and complete? |
| **Scalability**      | Can it handle large live streams? | Can it process large stored datasets? |

---

## ✅ 2. **Measure Execution Time**

Already handled in both modes:

- In Spark: You can log processing time per batch using:
```python
start = time.time()
# your spark processing
print(f"Batch processed in {time.time() - start:.2f}s")
```

- In Batch: Already logged via `time.time()`.

---

## ✅ 3. **Check Accuracy of Results**

Compare results like:

- Language-wise tweet counts
- Top hashtags/words
- Any sentiment or pattern analysis (if implemented)

```bash
[STREAMING] en = 120, hi = 30
[BATCH]     en = 120, hi = 30
✅ MATCH ✅
```

If there are mismatches, check for:
- Duplicate tweets in streaming
- Different time ranges of processed data

---

## ✅ 4. **Compare Resource Usage**

Use tools like:

- **top**, **htop**, or **task manager** during execution
- Look at Spark UI (`localhost:4040`) → Stages → Execution time, CPU, memory

Document:
- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Disk I/O (if any)

---

## ✅ 5. **Scalability Test (Optional but Valuable)**

Try with larger datasets:
- Simulate 1000+ tweets via Kafka
- Observe Spark batch delays or failures
- Try running the batch queries again and log execution time

---

## ✅ 6. **Document Your Comparison in a Table**

Example:

| Metric             | Streaming Mode                     | Batch Mode                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Execution Time     | ~2s per micro-batch (50 tweets)    | ~0.4s for 500 tweets           |
| Accuracy           | ✅ Same counts                     | ✅ Same counts                 |
| Resource Usage     | High CPU during Spark batch        | Low CPU, quick execution       |
| Real-Time Output   | ✅ Yes                              | ❌ No, only post-analysis      |
| Scalability        | Good with tuning                   | Depends on query efficiency    |

---

## ✅ 7. **Conclusion (For Report/Presentation)**

Summarize with something like:

> “Streaming processing with Apache Spark offers real-time updates and can scale with proper resource allocation, but it is resource-intensive. Batch processing via SQL is lightweight and suitable for retrospective analysis. In this project, both methods yielded consistent results, but streaming is more suitable for real-time dashboards, while batch mode is ideal for periodic reporting.”

## 📦 Optional Add-ons

- 📊 Create visualizations using `matplotlib` or `seaborn`
- 📁 Export batch results to CSV
- 🧪 Add a stress test: simulate burst input to Kafka
