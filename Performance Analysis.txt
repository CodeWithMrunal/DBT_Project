6. Document Your Comparison in a Table

Example:
Metric	        Streaming Mode	                Batch Mode
Execution Time	~2s per micro-batch (50 tweets)	~0.4s for 500 tweets
Accuracy	    ✅ Same counts	               ✅ Same counts
Resource Usage	High CPU during Spark batch	    Low CPU, quick execution
Real-Time Output	✅ Yes	                   ❌ No, only post-analysis
Scalability	Good with tuning	Depends on query efficiency
